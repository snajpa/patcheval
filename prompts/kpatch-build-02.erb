DYNUP KPATCH EVALUATION REPORT

With the following patch:

<%= @params[:diff] %>

For evaluating a Linux kernel patch for kpatch-build automatic live patching, focus on these concise criteria:

Function Granularity: The patch should modify functions rather than entire modules, as kpatch replaces old functions with new ones

Compatibility with kpatch-build: The patch must be compatible with the kpatch-build process, including the ability to build the kernel with and without the patch, and generate a patch module through comparison of binaries

Limitations: Be aware of kpatch's limitations, such as no support for patches that modify statically allocated structs, init functions, functions in vdso, or functions missing a fentry call. Creative solutions may overcome some limitations

Safety and Impact: Assess the patch's safety and its impact on system stability, especially for patches changing how functions interact with dynamically allocated data. The responsibility lies with the user to ensure the patch does not destabilize the system

By adhering to these streamlined criteria, you can effectively assess the suitability of a kernel patch for live patching with kpatch-build.
